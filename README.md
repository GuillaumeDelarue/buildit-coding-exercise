# buildIt-coding-exercise

* Simple Webcrawler
* Project done using Scala/Scalatest on 11/7/2016
* IntelliJ IDEA EAP 2016.2 preview used for IDE
* Gradle used for dependency management

* Using (partial) Acceptance-TDD: I wrote acceptance criteria first, which drove the code (first commit has the first acceptance criteria)
* Then used TDD to drive development
